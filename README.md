# **University Chatbot Evaluation Portal**

## **Comprehensive Comparative Study of Conversational AI Architectures**

This repository hosts the front-end interface and documentation for a comparative study evaluating six distinct chatbot architectures against a unified university-specific dataset. The primary goal is to determine the most optimal, robust, and efficient conversational framework for enhancing the student and administrative experience within the university ecosystem.

### **Team & Supervision**

**Supervisor Details:** Dr. Mohammad Rezwanul Huq is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at East West University, lending his expertise to guide this research project.

### **Project Goal**

Our primary objective is to engineer and evaluate a suite of multilingual chatbots. By comparing diverse architectural approaches, we aim to identify the optimal framework for developing a robust, efficient, and user-friendly chatbot solution tailored for the university ecosystem.

### **Technology Stack & Tools Used**

| Component | Technology |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Front-End Portal** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript |
| **Rule-Based Framework** | **Rasa Open Source** |
| **Knowledge Retrieval** | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** |
| **Small Language Models (SLM)** | **PHI-2 / Custom SLM** |
| **Large Language Models (LLM)** | (External LLM) |

### **Chatbot Models Under Evaluation**

We are testing six distinct models, ranging from fundamental rule-based systems to advanced hybrid architectures.

| Chatbot Name | Core Architecture & Functionality |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Rasa Bot** | **Rule-based (Rasa)** |
| **RAG Bot** | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** |
| **SLM Bot** | **Custom Small Language Model** |
| **Standard Bot** | **PHI-2 \+ RAG** |
| **Enhanced Bot** | **PHI-2 \+ RASA \+ RAG** |
| **Advanced Bot** | **LLM \+ RASA \+ RAG** |

### **Comparative Analysis Objectives**

The central focus is the comparative analysis across these six models, focusing on: **Accuracy/Groundedness**, **Response Latency**, and **Resource Utilization**. The results will inform the final recommendation for the university's deployment strategy.

### **Deployment**

This front-end portal is deployed automatically via **GitHub Pages**.
